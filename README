=== Storylines

This project is trying to take a new approach to writing stories. You (which
can be one or more people) create Characters, Events, and Locations. You then
create the Experiences that different characters have of the different events
that they are involved in, from their point of view. These may or may not be
accurate descriptions as they are meant to represent their memories. The event
has a record of an objective view of the events.

TODO:
* Add Things to represent items Characters can have. Probably needs to be
  polymorphic since Things could also be at a Location.
* Add version locking to prevent problems with collaborative editing and to
  give a sort of history of changes (like prior owners of Things perhaps?)
* Add authentication to limit what users can see and edit. Need to modify
  models to show creator and some kind of linkage to control what users can
  do. Then you could give users access to just view, or view and edit your
  creations.
* Add some kind of container object for Characters, Events and Locations. Maybe
  a Universe object. So one user could have multiple of these, and use them to
  logically divide different elements from each other. This could get a bit
  tricky since you might want to reuse different elements from other Universes.
* Finally, create Stories, which are lists of Event descriptions and Experiences
  in a particular order, sometimes with some sort of connective text, that tell
  a story of some kind. The connective text could be tags, or just text like
  the date that something is occuring. Then you would need some way to export
  that for printing, etc.
